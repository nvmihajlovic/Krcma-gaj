# Favicon Instructions

## Generate Your Favicon Icons

I've configured the site to use a complete favicon set. You'll need to generate the following files:

### Required Files:
1. **favicon-16x16.png** (16x16 pixels)
2. **favicon-32x32.png** (32x32 pixels)
3. **apple-touch-icon.png** (180x180 pixels)
4. **android-chrome-192x192.png** (192x192 pixels)
5. **android-chrome-512x512.png** (512x512 pixels)

### How to Generate:

#### Option 1: Use RealFaviconGenerator (Recommended)
1. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload your logo/icon (minimum 260x260px, PNG format recommended)
3. Customize appearance for different platforms if desired
4. Generate and download the package
5. Extract and place all files in your website root folder

#### Option 2: Use Favicon.io
1. Go to https://favicon.io/
2. Choose from:
   - Upload an image (your logo)
   - Generate from text (e.g., "КГ" or "KG")
   - Generate from emoji
3. Download the package
4. Place all files in your website root folder

#### Option 3: Manual Creation (Photoshop/GIMP)
1. Create your logo at 512x512px
2. Resize to each required dimension
3. Export as PNG with transparency
4. Name files exactly as listed above

### Design Recommendations:
- **Simple design** - favicons are very small, keep it clear
- **High contrast** - ensure visibility on various backgrounds
- **Recognizable symbol** - use "КГ" letters or a simple mountain/food icon
- **Brand colors** - use your summer theme orange (#d97706) or similar
- **Square format** - design should work well in a square space

### Current Placeholder:
The site is configured for these files but they don't exist yet. Browsers will show default icon until you add them.

### Files Already Created:
✅ **site.webmanifest** - PWA configuration file (already configured)
